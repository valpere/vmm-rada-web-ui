description: Multi-model PR review pipeline. Dispatches the diff concurrently to 3 reviewer models (config.yaml), tallies vote counts per finding (informational), then Claude acts as arbiter (CONFIRM / DISMISS / DEFER) and merges when clean. Invoke with an optional PR number (defaults to the current branch's open PR). Dependabot PRs are handled by the global dependabot-reviewer agent, not this skill.

# /fix-review

Multi-model PR review pipeline for vmm-rada-web-ui.

For Dependabot PRs, use the global `dependabot-reviewer` agent
(`~/.claude/agents/dependabot-reviewer.md`) instead — risk-based SemVer
triage, not this pipeline.

## Code Review Pyramid (arbiter evaluates in this order — base first)

```
        ▲
       /5\    Style       → NEVER flagged — ESLint handles this
      /---\
     / 4   \  Tests       → Critical paths covered? (Vitest + Testing Library)
    /-------\
   /    3    \ Docs        → Complex logic explained?
  /           \
 /      2      \ Implementation → Bugs, null checks, stale closures, SSE
/_______________\                 handling, XSS/security, performance
       1          Architecture   → Adapter-boundary violations, state
                                    writes outside App.jsx, raw HTML
                                    rendering of LLM output
```

**Priority:** Layer 1 errors → Layer 1 warnings → Layer 2 errors → Layer 2 warnings → Layer 3–4 → suggestions. An architectural flaw makes implementation fixes irrelevant — always fix from the base up.

**Layer 1 checks are the four immutable rules in `.claude/context-essentials.md`** — components stay pure UI, `src/api.js` is the sole adapter boundary, `App.jsx` owns all state, `react-markdown` is the only LLM-output renderer. Treat any diff that violates these as a Layer 1 error regardless of what the reviewer models flag.

## Pipeline

```
Concurrent dispatch (config.yaml reviewers.openrouter.*):
  Reviewer model 1 (round_1) ──┐
  Reviewer model 2 (round_2) ──┼──→ JSON findings arrays
  Reviewer model 3 (round_3) ──┘
       ↓
  Vote tally: group by file:line, attach count N/3 (informational only)
  All findings reach the arbiter — votes do not gate
       ↓
  Arbiter (Claude, main instance)
    → full diff + all findings with vote metadata
    → CONFIRM / DISMISS / DEFER each finding
    → fix CONFIRM findings → commit+push
    → post PR comment with vote table
    → merge if no CONFIRM blockers remain
```

Note: `config.yaml` uses `round_1/round_2/round_3` keys for historical reasons — these
are concurrent dispatches, not sequential rounds. The models to use are always read from
`config.yaml`; do not hardcode model names here.

CLI failover tier (config.yaml `reviewers.cli`) engages automatically when the Ollama
cloud endpoint probe fails — same flow, local models instead of cloud.

## Step-by-step execution

### 0. Resolve PR

If an argument was given, use that PR number. Otherwise run:
```bash
gh pr view --json number,headRefName,state,author
```
Confirm the PR is open. If `author.login == "dependabot[bot]"`, stop and
tell the user to invoke the `dependabot-reviewer` agent instead — this
skill is for human-authored PRs. Store the PR number as `$PR`.

### 1. Fetch the full diff

```bash
gh pr diff $PR
```

Store it as the **baseline diff** (used in dispatch and arbiter pass).

### 2. Load reviewer config

Read `.claude/skills/fix-review/config.yaml`. Extract:
- `reviewers.openrouter.round_1/2/3` — cloud reviewer models
- `openrouter_api_url` — Ollama endpoint (`http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions`)
- `reviewers.cli` — local failover models (used if cloud endpoint unreachable)

First, extract the actual model names you just read from `config.yaml`:
```bash
# Use the exact model name strings from reviewers.openrouter.round_1/2/3
ROUND1="<exact round_1 model string>"   # e.g. qwen3.5:cloud
ROUND2="<exact round_2 model string>"   # e.g. minimax-m2.7:cloud
ROUND3="<exact round_3 model string>"   # e.g. gemma4:31b-cloud
```

Then probe the endpoint:
```bash
MODELS_JSON=$(curl -sf --max-time 5 http://localhost:11434/v1/models 2>/dev/null)

if [ -z "$MODELS_JSON" ]; then
  TIER="cli"
  echo "⚠️  Ollama endpoint unreachable — using CLI tier"
else
  # Extract model IDs robustly (handles spaces after colon in JSON)
  AVAILABLE=$(echo "$MODELS_JSON" | grep -oP '"id"\s*:\s*"\K[^"]+')
  if echo "$AVAILABLE" | grep -qF "$ROUND1" \
     || echo "$AVAILABLE" | grep -qF "$ROUND2" \
     || echo "$AVAILABLE" | grep -qF "$ROUND3"; then
    TIER="cloud"
  else
    TIER="cli"
    echo "⚠️  Ollama online but none of the configured models loaded — using CLI tier"
    echo "    Expected one of: $ROUND1 | $ROUND2 | $ROUND3"
  fi
fi
```

If `TIER="cli"` for any reason → use CLI failover tier (`reviewers.cli`).

### 3. Concurrent review dispatch

Build the review prompt combining the baseline diff with instructions:

> "Review this PR diff. Return ONLY a raw JSON array of findings — no prose, no markdown
> fences. Each finding: `{\"file\": \"path\", \"line\": N, \"layer\": 1-5, \"severity\":
> \"error|warn|sugg\", \"description\": \"...\"}`. Flag only real issues per the Code
> Review Pyramid. Layer 5 (style) is never flagged."

Send the prompt to each reviewer model via `ollama-review.sh`:

```bash
PROMPT="<diff + instructions>"

R1=$(echo "$PROMPT" | bash .claude/skills/fix-review/ollama-review.sh <round_1_model>)
R2=$(echo "$PROMPT" | bash .claude/skills/fix-review/ollama-review.sh <round_2_model>)
R3=$(echo "$PROMPT" | bash .claude/skills/fix-review/ollama-review.sh <round_3_model>)
```

Each call returns a JSON array (empty `[]` on parse failure — safe degradation).

### 4. Tally findings

Merge all three arrays. Group findings by `file:line`. For each unique `file:line`,
count how many of the 3 models flagged it.

Attach `votes: N/3` to each finding as **informational metadata only**. All findings
(even `votes: 1/3`) are passed to the arbiter — vote counts are a confidence signal,
not a gate. The arbiter's dismiss rate (~80%) is the actual filter.

### 5. Arbiter pass (Claude, main instance)

Re-fetch the full diff post-dispatch (should be unchanged, but confirms branch state):
```bash
gh pr diff $PR
```

For each finding (ordered Layer 1 first), apply the Code Review Pyramid:

| Ruling | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **CONFIRM** | Real issue, correctly identified | Fix it |
| **ESCALATE** | Real issue, more severe than flagged | Fix it, note severity upgrade |
| **DISMISS** | False positive or conflicts with project patterns | Skip, note reason |
| **DEFER** | Valid concern, out of scope for this PR | Create a GitHub issue |

Also run an **independent scan** of the full diff — look for anything the models missed,
especially violations of the four immutable rules in `context-essentials.md` (a direct
`fetch`/`api.js` call from a component, a state write outside `App.jsx`, raw HTML
rendering of LLM output, a new competing renderer).

For CONFIRM/ESCALATE findings:
1. Apply the fix using Edit.
2. Commit + push:
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix(pr#$PR): arbiter — address confirmed findings"
git push
```

For DEFER findings:
```bash
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."
```

### 6. Post PR comment

Post a single collapsible summary:

```
<details>
<summary>/fix-review — parallel pass · N findings · N confirmed · N dismissed · N deferred</summary>

| File:Line | Votes | Layer | Sev | Ruling | Note |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----|--------|------|
| src/components/Stage2.jsx:42 | 2/3 | 2 | error | CONFIRM | missing null check on metadata.label_to_model |
| src/api.js:87 | 1/3 | 5 | sugg | DISMISS | style — not flagged by pyramid |

Models: <round_1_model>, <round_2_model>, <round_3_model> (from config.yaml)
Arbiter: Claude Sonnet 4.6

</details>
```

### 7. Merge decision

Run before merging:
```bash
npm run lint
npm test
```
Block merge if either fails.

**Proceed to merge** if:
- No unresolved CONFIRM blockers remain
- All High-severity security findings are CONFIRM (fixed) or DISMISS (justified)
- `npm run lint` and `npm test` both pass

**Block merge** if:
- Any unfixed High-severity security finding exists
- Lint or tests fail

Merge with squash:
```bash
gh pr merge $PR --squash --delete-branch
```

Then sync main:
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
```

## Exit conditions

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| All findings arbitrated, no blockers | Merge |
| Cloud endpoint unreachable | Fall back to CLI tier, proceed |
| Model returns non-JSON | Treat as 0 findings for that model, proceed |
| Round fails to push | Stop, report error to user |
| PR already merged | Report and exit |
| PR has merge conflicts | Stop, ask user to resolve |
| `npm run lint` or `npm test` fails | Fix if trivial and in scope, else block merge and report |
| PR authored by dependabot[bot] | Stop, direct user to `dependabot-reviewer` agent |
